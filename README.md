Very simple spring java application that will expose 5 endpoints.  Will do the following
1.  use liquibase for database management
2.  use spring jpa for database connectivity
3.  Use standard spring practices for controller/repository/service layer
4.  Add custom HTTP validation response if necessary
5.  Junit tests testing each layer of the java application using Mocks
